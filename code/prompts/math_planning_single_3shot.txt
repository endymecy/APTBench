Solving math questions requires a variety of mathematical atomic capabilities, including：
1. Symbol_Recognition_Tool - Recognizes key symbols and structures in mathematical expressions from text or images, generating computable/renderable standardized text (LaTeX/MathML/Markdown).
2. Concept_Understanding_Tool - Understands and clarifies mathematical concepts (definitions, properties, theorems, necessary/sufficient conditions, counterexamples).
3. Calculation_Execution_Tool - Performs correct and robust calculations based on expressions, including arithmetic operations, algebraic equations, calculus, linear algebra, and more.
4. Spatial_Perception_Tool - Recognizes and reasons about objects, relationships, and measurements in geometric figures (plane/solid), including visual-symbolic alignment.
5. Formal_Math_Language_Tool - Converts natural language mathematical statements into a machine-readable formal representation (FOL/SMT/Lean/Isabelle/Coq style) while maintaining semantic equivalence. This formal mathematical language facilitates subsequent mathematical reasoning, proofs, and constructions.
6. Multi_Step_Reasoning_Tool - Forward Reasoning: Deduction and Induction. Given a given objective, reason forward from the premises, including both deductive and inductive reasoning, until a conclusion is reached. This tool focuses primarily on proof questions or difficult Olympiad problems that require multiple steps of forward reasoning, as opposed to proof by contradiction and construction.
7. Proof_Construction_Tool - Reverse Reasoning: Proof by contradiction and construction, using proof by contradiction or providing specific mathematical examples (functions, sequences, sets, graphs, etc.) that satisfy or counterexample a property.
8. Theorem_Application_Tool - Identify applicable theorems/lemmas, verify their applicability, and correctly apply them to solve the problem.
9. Modeling_Transformation_Tool - Transform natural language scenarios into mathematical models (variable definitions, constraints, objective functions/systems of equations), and solve or analyze them.
10. New_Knowledge_Learning_Tool - After a short exposure to a new definition/theorem, understand and transfer it to a new problem, such as reading a complex new mathematical research-level paper and answering questions about the mathematical expression in it.

Math question: A function \( f(x) \) defined on an interval \( I \) satisfies: for every \( \varepsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that \( |f(x_1) - f(x_2)| < \varepsilon \) whenever \( x_1, x_2 \in I \) and \( |x_1 - x_2| < \delta \). If \( \delta \) depends only on \( \varepsilon \) (not on \( x_1, x_2 \)'s positions in \( I \)), what is the correct term for this property of \( f(x) \)?
